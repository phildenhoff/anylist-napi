# Beads local issue tracker

We use [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking.
Beads is a repo-first issue tracking, perfect for coding agents.
The main UI is via a cli, `bd`, which you may have to install.

## Quick Start

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Create new issues
bd create "Add user authentication"

# View all issues
bd list

# View issue details
bd show <issue-id>

# Update issue status
bd update <issue-id> --status in_progress
bd update <issue-id> --status done

# Sync with git remote
bd sync
```

### Working with Issues

Issues in Beads are:

- **Git-native**: Stored in `.beads/issues.jsonl` and synced like code
- **AI-friendly**: CLI-first design works perfectly with AI coding agents
- **Branch-aware**: Issues can follow your branch workflow
- **Always in sync**: Auto-syncs with your commits
